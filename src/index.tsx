						Sunflowers represent positivity, adoration, and loyalty. I like them because of their bright colors, and they've been my favorite since I was little.
						<br /><br />
						"Sunflowers are my favorite", you said.
						<br /><br />
						I was surprised that we shared the same favorite flower. It made me feel more connected with you.
						<br /><br />
						Yellow was a color I despised in the past because of its "overpowering" brightness. But, recently.. something changed. That same brightness, that I used to dislike, became the reason that I started to like it.. and recently, I started to like it more.. because of you.
						<br /><br />
						Because of you, I started liking yellow. Because of you, the brightness that I deemed overpowering became something I wholeheartedly embrace. Because of you, I started believing in love, in doing everything in the name of love, of pouring my entire heart onto love.
						<br /><br />
						You are my sunflower, someone I view positively, someone I adore, and someone I owe full loyalty to.<br />
						You are my yellow, someone who makes everything brighter with your odd humor, chaotic personality, laughs, and smiles.
						<br /><br />
						Consider this a formal confession of feelings and intentions. I love you. I truly do. I intend this to be serious... not just something casual, not something ambiguous, but something genuine... <br /><br />
